The visuals you'll see on my Tableau page display a line graph, the number of bikes checked, and a filter mechanism to output data by hour. I implemented a new data point and gender into my line graph, and was also able to filter out checked out bikes by a specific gender each hour. The heat map shown is optimal, showing comprehensive data about checked bikes by the days of the week and you can also filter by user and gender.

I created a total of 7 visualizations.
